[00:00:00.150 - 00:00:04.408]
To assess curvature using Lutein\u0027s Method, follow this process:

[00:00:04.558 - 00:00:09.875]
Identify the canal orifice, (Point A), and the apical foramen, (Point D).

[00:00:09.876 - 00:00:12.924]
Mark 2mm along the canal from each, to

[00:00:13.074 - 00:00:17.053]
give points B and C. Draw two lines, A to B, and C to D.

[00:00:17.203 - 00:00:21.286]
The angle created at the intersection of these two lines

[00:00:21.436 - 00:00:25.636]
is the degree of canal curvature

[00:00:25.786 - 00:00:29.048]
simply choose the most severe curvature for your assessment.
